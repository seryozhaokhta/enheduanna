                <h2>Before Enheduana's birth</h2>
                <p>
                    Before Enheduana's time, Southern Iraq was a region of independent city-states like Ur, Uruk, Nippur, Kish, Lagash, Umma, and Sippar. These city-states were politically autonomous and engaged in conflicts, peace pacts, and exchanges of goods and ideas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Enheduana was born into a dynasty founded by her father, Sargon of Akkad. Sargon, known for establishing the first empire in recorded history, was married to Tashlultum. The details about Sargon's marital life are somewhat obscure, with the possibility of multiple wives, thus raising questions about whether Enheduana, along with her siblings Rimush and Manishtushu, were full siblings or half-siblings. This uncertainty adds a layer of complexity to the family dynamics within the ruling elite of the Akkadian Empire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The succession of power after Sargon's reign brought periods of political turbulence and transformation. Sargon's immediate successors, his sons Rimush and Manishtushu, faced significant challenges during their reigns. Rimush, who possibly had no children, ruled for nine years before the throne passed to Manishtushu. The latter's rule, lasting fifteen years, was marked by his eventual assassination, indicative of the perilous nature of their leadership and the inherent instability within the empire. These tumultuous times set the stage for the ascent of Naram-Sin, Manishtushu's son and Enheduana's nephew.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Naram-Sin's era was distinct in its approach to rulership and imperial expansion. He reigned for four decades, during which he expanded the empire, quelled revolts, and notably, proclaimed himself a living god, a radical departure from traditional Mesopotamian views of kingship. Under his leadership, the Akkadian Empire reached its zenith, both politically and culturally. Naram-Sin continued the practice of appointing family members to significant positions, installing his son Nabi-Ulmash as governor and his daughters Tutanabshum and Shumshani as high priestesses. His daughter Enmenana followed in Enheduana's footsteps, taking over as high priestess in Ur, thereby maintaining the family's influence and legacy in the region's religious and political spheres.

                <h2>Birth of Enheduana and the Akkadian Era</h2>
                <p>
                    Enheduana was the daughter of Sargon of Akkad, an emperor who founded the first known empire in history. This period marked a significant transformation as Sargon and his successors reshaped the conquered cities, including Ur, one of the largest cities in the empire where Enheduana was made high priestess.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her appointment as high priestess was part of the political overhaul undertaken by her father, which was unpopular among the old Sumerian nobles, leading to constant revolts. A limestone disk inscribed with Enheduana's name confirms her historical existence and her position as the daughter of Sargon and the high priestess of Nanna.

                <h2>Rebellion and expulsion of Enheduanna</h2>
                <p>Enheduana's period was marked by significant political and social upheaval, with the Akkadian empire imposing changes in power dynamics and language, as both Akkadian and Sumerian were spoken in the region. Enheduana experienced a period of personal turmoil and despair, which she expressed in her poetry. She metaphorically described her process of composing a hymn to Inana as a form of giving birth to the text.</p>

                <h2>Comeback and legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    The hymn she composed, an appeal to the goddess Inana, was successful in restoring Enheduana to her position as high priestess. This act of composing and offering the hymn demonstrated the power and impact of eloquent hymns in her time. Enheduana's legacy is significant as she is remembered as the world's first known author and a central figure in the history of literature and religious practice. This outline provides a comprehensive overview of Enheduana's life and legacy, encompassing the major phases from before her birth, through her life in the Akkadian era, her experiences of rebellion and expulsion, and her eventual comeback and lasting impact.
